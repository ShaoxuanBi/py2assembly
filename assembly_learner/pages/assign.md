# Assign

The process of assigning a value to a variable is called an assignment. A statement that assigns a certain value to a variable is called an assignment statement. Where the "value" may be a number, a string or an expression.
Assignment is the most basic operation in the syntax, and in high-level programming languages it is directly represented by the symbol "=". However, in the Sigma 16 assembly language,  it is represented using the instruction "data". Among them, all operations are performed in registers, the value of the variable is stored in a register using the instruction "load", the value of the variable is assigned using the instruction "lea" and the value of the register give to the variable using the instruction "store".
