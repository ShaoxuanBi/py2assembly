# Assign

The process of assigning a value to a variable is called assignment. A statement that assigns a certain value to a
variable is called an assignment statement. Each programming language has its own assignment statement, and there are
different types of assignment statements. The assigned "value" can be a number, a string or an expression.

In assembly, for an initial value, it can be written directly in memory. For overwriting the value in memory, it is
necessary to write from the register.
